Things like \"<strong>Burning Man</strong>,\" \"<strong>Decompression Party</strong>,\" and all of the <strong>Ten Principles</strong>. To license this stuff, communities agree to behave within certain cultural norms defined by The Burning Man Project. This agreement does not work both ways, and licensors have no control over the brand that they have licensed nor the behaviour of The Burning Man Project itself.",
  "what_is_openburn_content": "Project Bonfire exists to create and maintain a set of open source tools and resources that empower communities to define themselves, organise, and create experiences together. Everything will always be free to use, copy, modify, and distribute in any way. This toolkit is intended to support community-building, but communities have different needs and no one toolkit can meet them all. Use the parts that work, and ignore the parts that don't. We welcome contributions to the project from anyone who wants to help make things better.",
  "community_needs": "We believe that successful communities are united by <strong>communal values</strong>, enabled by open source <strong>tools</strong>, and supported by strong global <strong>network</strong>.
